## Installing chARpack
To install chARpack, go to our download page (link TBA) and get the version for your desired platform.
We recommend to always install the windows standalone app (link TBA) since chARpack works best in conjunction with a desktop PC.

### Windows
After downloading the archive, navigate to your download location and extract the contents to a desired location.
In the extraction folder, you can find the executable `chARpack.exe`, which you  can use to start the app.

### Universal Windows
Download chARpack's Universal Windows build (link TBA) and extract the archive.
Turn on your device and connect to the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/debug-test-perf/device-portal" target="_blank">device portal</a> via your browser.
Navigate to `Apps` via the side bar and click on `Browse...` on the section `Deploy apps`.
Then, navigate to the extracted folder and select the `.appx` file.
Press the `Install` button to initiate the upload and install of chARpack.

### Android
Download chARpack's Android build (link TBA) and extract the archive.
To be able to install chARpack to your Meta Quest device, you need to download and install the <a href="https://developer.oculus.com/downloads/package/oculus-developer-hub-win" target="_blank">Meta Quest Developer Hub</a>.
In the developer hub, navigate to `Device Manager` in the side bar.
Here you can add your device and turn on the **Developer Mode**.
Now you can simply drag-and-drop the `.apk` file onto the developer hub (on the right hand side) to deploy directly to the device.
