## Installing chARpack
To install chARpack, go to our [download page](https://github.com/KoehnLab/chARpack/releases) and get the version for your desired platform.
We recommend to always install the windows standalone app since chARpack works best in conjunction with a desktop PC.

### Windows
After downloading the archive, navigate to your download location and extract the contents to a desired location.
In the extraction folder, you can find the executable `chARpack.exe`, which you  can use to start the app.

### Universal Windows
Download chARpack's Universal Windows build ([here](https://github.com/KoehnLab/chARpack/releases)).
Turn on your device and connect to the [device portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/debug-test-perf/device-portal) via your browser.
Navigate to `Apps` via the side bar and click on `Browse...` on the section `Deploy apps` and select the downloaded `.appx` file.
Press the `Install` button to initiate the upload and install of chARpack.

### Android
Download chARpack's Android build ([here](https://github.com/KoehnLab/chARpack/releases)).
To be able to install chARpack to your Meta Quest device, you need to download and install the [Meta Quest Developer Hub](https://developer.oculus.com/downloads/package/oculus-developer-hub-win).
In the developer hub, navigate to `Device Manager` in the side bar.
Here you can add your device and turn on the **Developer Mode**.
Now you can simply drag-and-drop the `.apk` file onto the developer hub (on the right hand side) to deploy directly to the device.
