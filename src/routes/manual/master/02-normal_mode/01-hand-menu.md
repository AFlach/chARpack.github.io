## Overview
The hand menu provides a fast and comfortable way to create atoms by attaching an atom selection menu to the user's hand.

### Usage
The hand menu can be opened by turning the flat palm of your left hand towards your face.
It automatically closes upon turning or closing your hand.
If you would prefer not to use the hand menu functionality, it can be deactivated in the Settings menu.
However, be aware that this also deactivates the **Fragment rotation mode** and **Measurement mode** button, meaning you can no longer switch between interaction modes.

### Buttons
- **Atom buttons**: The main content of the menu; pressing one of them creates an atom of the corresponding type.
- **Scroll buttons**: The arrows on the right are used to scroll up and down to find different atom types.
- **Fragment rotation mode button**: This button appears in the palm of the user. 
Pressing it toggles the interaction mode that enables fragment rotation/moving an entire chain of connected atoms in a certain direction.
- **Measurement mode button**: This button appears below the **Fragment rotation mode** button. 
It is used to activate/deactivate the interaction mode used for measuring angles and distances.
