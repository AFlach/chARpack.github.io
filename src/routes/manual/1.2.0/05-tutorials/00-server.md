title: Tutorials - Server

## General 
In order to easily introduce users to chARpack's functionalities, it provides some tutorials.
Tutorials can be found in subfolders in `Assets > StreamingAssets > tutorials`. 
Each tutorial is available both in German and in English.

## Using tutorials
On the server interface, you can find a **Load Tutorial** button to the left.
By clicking on this and then navigating to the desired tutorial in the given file manager, a tutorial is started.
The resulting window will look similar to this image:

![Server Tutorial $class="mx-auto max-w-xl"](server_tutorial.png)

You can end the tutorial at any time by pressing the **X** button on the top left.
The button below it in the left toolbar opens a small settings menu.
If you are stuck on any task, the **?** button can give you hints on what you need to do.
The eye button on the bottom center can be used to hide the tutorial window; if you want to show it again, use the **Hide/Show Tutorial** button of the server scene.

The main tutorial contents are dependent on the exact tutorial you are using; they usually consist of a list of subtasks that need to be completed.
Each subtask is marked by an exclamation mark, whereas the text in between gives some additional information or structure.
If subtasks need to be completed in a specific order, all subtasks after the currently active one are greyed out.
The system automatically tracks your task progress.
Once a subtask is completeted, it turns green and the next subtask becomes available.
Having finished the instructions on a page, use the **Next** button to progress to the next part of the tutorial.
